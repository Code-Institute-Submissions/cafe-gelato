  ## **Bugs**

### **Solved bugs**
 - When I first tested my html file for bugs i found out that I have written 100% width in my iframe tag. 
 - I solved that bug by first remove the 100% width in the html file. After that I made a class called "map" in the html and the css file. I then added 100% width in the map class inside the css file. That solved the bug and kept the maps width across the whole screen.
